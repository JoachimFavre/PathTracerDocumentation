# Path Tracer Documentation
This is the code for the documentation of a Path Tracer I wrote throughout 2020 in the context of my Travail de Maturit√© (see [my repository](https://github.com/JoachimFavre/PathTracer)). The documentation can found at the following url: https://joachimfavre.github.io/PathTracerDocumentation/.

This documentation was generated using [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) 1.8.20. The parameters I defined can be found in the following files: Doxyfile, DoxygenLayout.xml, ExtraStyleSheet.css, MainPage.md and footer.html.

I also wrote a little python script (not very properly, but it works) that turns doxygen documentation written right before each function into a block of text that can be put at the beginning of the file. See its docstring for further information. This file is named documentationConversion.py.
